# budget-tracker-all-in-one

Implement a budgeting app with the following features:

1. Add Transaction Page:
- Form to enter transaction details like date, amount, type (income/expense), and category (dropdown with options like groceries, bills, salary)
- "Add Transaction" button to submit the form
- After submitting, display a success message

2. Transactions List Page:  
- Table showing a list of all transactions with columns for date, amount, type, and category
- "Add Transaction" button that links to the Add Transaction page

3. Edit Transaction Page:
- Form pre-filled with details of the transaction being edited
- Ability to modify date, amount, type and category 
- "Save" button to update the transaction
- After saving, redirect back to Transactions List page

4. Delete Transaction Functionality:
- "Delete" button next to each transaction in the Transactions List table
- Clicking "Delete" should remove that transaction 
- Display a confirmation before actually deleting

Use Chakra UI components where appropriate. Mock the data with an array of sample transactions.
